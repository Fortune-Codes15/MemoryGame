## Why did i build this ?

I know this looks like a lot but trust me i will get through the first five features. Well as none of you know i am probably typing this while i am sick and me being sick makes me all _how do you say_ more enthusiastic..... Anyways enthusiasm aside my brother _younger..._ said i can't code or program that memory game from purble game so i took it as a challenge and created my own emoji based purble place and made it even more _how do you say better_
